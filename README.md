DuelHabit ⚔️🔥
Turn wellness into a friendly competition.

DuelHabit is a social wellness app that lets you duel habits with your friends, whether that’s going to the gym, studying, journaling, or anything else you want to improve on. Instead of building habits alone (and quitting after 3 days), DuelHabit adds accountability, competition, and fun to help you stay consistent.

How It’s Made

Tech used:
React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT Authentication, Vite

DuelHabit was built as a full-stack project focused on making habit-building actually fun. On the frontend, we used React with Vite to create a fast, responsive UI that makes dueling feel lightweight and engaging instead of overwhelming. We designed components around quick actions: starting a duel, checking progress, and seeing who’s winning with a group and global leaderboard.

The backend is powered by FastAPI, which handles user authentication, duel logic, habit tracking, and XP calculations. We used JWT authentication to securely manage user sessions and MongoDB to store users, quests, groups, and duel progress. A lot of thought went into structuring the API routes cleanly so the frontend could stay simple and focused on user experience.

Overall, this project pushed us to think not just about writing code, but about product decisions: what motivates people, what makes an app fun to open daily, and how small social features can create big behavior changes.

Lessons Learned

Building DuelHabit taught us that motivation is a design problem as much as a technical one. We learned how powerful social accountability can be when combined with clean UI and simple interactions.

From a technical standpoint, we gained hands-on experience with:

connecting a React frontend to a FastAPI backend

implementing secure authentication with JWT

designing APIs that scale with new features

collaborating in GitHub and iterating quickly

We also learned how to work on a product with a team (much more difficult than expected but very rewarding!)
